## Background

In Apache ShardingSphere, many functionality implementation are uploaded through SPI. [Service Provider Interface (SPI)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/SPI-intro.html) is a kind of API for the third party to implement or expand, which can be applied in framework expansion or component replacement.

Apache ShardingSphere uses SPI to expand in order to optimize overall architecture design at most. It is to enable premier users, who have implemented interfaces provided by Apache ShardingSphere, to dynamically load self-defined implementation types. Therefore, it can satisfy their practical requirements for different scenarios, while keeping architecture integrity and functional stabilization.

This chapter has provided all the Apache ShardingSphere functional modules that are loaded through SPI. Users with no special requirements can use them to implement corresponding functions after simple configurations. Premier users can develop self-defined implementations, referring to interfaces of existing functional modules. Welcome to feed your self-defined implementations to the [open-source community](https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pulls), benefiting more users.

### SQL Passing

The SQL parsing interface is used to regulate ANTLR file for SQL parse.

Its main interface is `SQLParserEntry` and built-in implementation types are `MySQLParserEntry`, `PostgreSQLParserEntry`, `SQLServerParserEntry` and `OracleParserEntry`.

Please refer to [SQL Parsing](/en/features/sharding/principle/parse/) for the introduction.

### Database Protocol

The database protocol interface is used to regulate parse and adapter protocol of database access for Sharding-Proxy.

Its main interface is `DatabaseProtocolFrontendEngine` and built-in implementation types are `MySQLProtocolFrontendEngine` and `PostgreSQLProtocolFrontendEngine`.

### Data Masking

The Data masking interface is used to regulate the encryption, decryption, access type, property configuration and other methods of the encryptor.

There are mainly two interfaces, `ShardingEncryptor` and `ShardingQueryAssistedEncryptor` and built-in implementation types are `AESShardingEncryptor` and `MD5ShardingEncryptor`. 

Please refer to [Data Masking](/en/features/orchestration/encrypt/) for the introduction.

### Distributed Primary Key

The distributed primary key interface is to regulate how to generate overall auto-increment, type access and property configurations.

Its main interface is `ShardingKeyGenerator` and built-in implementation types are `UUIDShardingKeyGenerator` and `SnowflakeShardingKeyGenerator`.

Please refer to [Distributed Primary Key](/en/features/sharding/other-features/key-generator/) for the introduction.

### Distributed Transaction

The distributed transaction interface is to regulate how to adapter distributed transaction to local transaction API.

Its main interface is `ShardingTransactionManager` and built-in implementation types are `XAShardingTransactionManager` and `SeataATShardingTransactionManager`.

Please refer to [Distributed Transaction](/en/features/transaction/) for the introduction.

### XA Transaction Manager

The XA transaction manager interface is to regulate how to adapter XA transaction manager's implementors to unified XA transaction manager API.

Its main interface is `XATransactionManager` and built-in implementation types are `AtomikosTransactionManager`, `NarayanaXATransactionManager` and `BitronixXATransactionManager`.

Please refer to [XA Transaction Manager](/en/features/concept/2pc-xa-transaction/) for the introduction.

### Registry Center

The registry center interface is used to regulate its initialization, data storage, data upgrade, monitoring and others.

Its main interface is `RegistryCenter` and built-in implementation types are Zookeeper.

Please refer to [Available Registry Center](/en/features/orchestration/supported-registry-repo/) for the introduction.

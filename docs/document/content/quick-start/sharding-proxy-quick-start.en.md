## 1. Sharding Rule Configuration

Edit `%SHARDING_PROXY_HOME%\conf\config-xxx.yaml`. Please refer to [Configuration Manual](/en/manual/sharding-proxy/configuration/) for more details.

Edit `%SHARDING_PROXY_HOME%\conf\server.yaml`. Please refer to [Configuration Manual](/en/manual/sharding-proxy/configuration/) for more details.

## 2. Introduce Dependencies

If the backend database is PostgreSQL, there's no need for additional dependencies.

If the backend database is MySQL, download [MySQL Connector/J](https://cdn.mysql.com//Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.47.tar.gz) 
and decompress, then copy mysql-connector-java-5.1.47.jar to ${sharding-proxy}\lib directory.

## 3. Start Server

* Use default configuration to start

```sh
${sharding-proxy}\bin\start.sh
```

* Configure the port

```sh
${sharding-proxy}\bin\start.sh ${port}
```
